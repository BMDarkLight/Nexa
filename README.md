## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- An `.env` file created based on `.env.example` with your environment variables, including keys like:

```env
SYSADMIN_USERNAME=admin
SYSADMIN_PASSWORD=changeme
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
MAIL_FROM=your_verified_email@example.com
```

### Running the Project with Docker

Build and start the containers using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will start the FastAPI backend and the Next.js frontend, exposing their respective ports.
